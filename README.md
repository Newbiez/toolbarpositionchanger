Toolbar Position Changer
========

A Firefox extension to change the vertical position of toolbars.

## Features
- Change the vertical position of toolbars.
- Set any browser toolbar visibility to hidden.
- Move toolbars to the bottom of the browser window. 

## Important
The extension is build on top of my own experiment WebExtension API.
It must be used with either Firefox Nightly or Firefox Developer Edition
with a permission to load the experiment API as a legacy add-on.

## Notes
Report issues and feature requests on the Github support page.
